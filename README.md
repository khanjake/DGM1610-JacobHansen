I love scripting, so much
Just starting a daily habit of looking at my code and adding a few lines every day to drill in the habit. In the meantime I'll work on some art and 3d modeling
I just am trying to forge the habit early so I can maintain my skills and work ethic early on. I hope for this to prove to you I'm trying
